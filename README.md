# 💕 Valentine's Day Proposal App

A beautiful, classy, and cute Streamlit application to ask someone special to be your Valentine!

## Features

- ✨ Beautiful gradient background with smooth animations
- 💕 Elegant typography with romantic fonts
- 🎈 Floating heart animations
- 🎉 Confetti celebration when they say "Yes"
- 😄 Interactive "No" button that runs away from the cursor (just for fun!)

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python installed (3.7 or higher)

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the App

Simply run:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open in your default web browser automatically!

## How It Works

1. The app displays a beautiful, romantic interface with floating hearts
2. Two buttons appear: "Yes 💕" and "No"
3. When the cursor approaches the "No" button, it playfully moves away
4. If they click "Yes", you'll see a celebration message with confetti!
5. If they click "No", they can try again (maybe they'll change their mind! 😊)

## Customization

Feel free to customize:
- Colors in the CSS gradient
- Text messages
- Font sizes and styles
- Animation speeds

Good luck! 💖
